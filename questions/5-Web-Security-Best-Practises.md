# Website Security Best Practises Questions & Answers

## Question:
Tell me all the security best practices you can think of - start with the most important ones first.

## Answer:

### 1. Writing Secure Code  
Ensuring security at the code level is the first step in building a resilient web application. By following secure coding practices, developers can minimize vulnerabilities and prevent potential exploits.  

Here are some key techniques to write secure code:  
- **Validate User Input**: Always sanitize and validate user input to mitigate risks like SQL Injection and XSS.  
- **Use Safe Database Queries**: Implement parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent injection attacks.  
- **Protect Sensitive Information**: Avoid storing credentials, API keys, or secrets in source code; use environment variables or secure vaults instead.  
- **Implement Strong Encryption**: Utilize reliable cryptographic libraries to encrypt sensitive data securely.  
- **Perform Regular Code Audits**: Conduct periodic reviews and security testing to identify and patch vulnerabilities early.

### 2. Use HTTPS (SSL/TLS Encryption)
- Ensure all data transmitted between users and the website is encrypted using SSL/TLS to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

### 3. Implement Strong Authentication & Authorization
- Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for admin and sensitive accounts.
- Enforce strong password policies (length, complexity, expiration).
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and the principle of least privilege.

### 4. Sanitize & Validate User Input (Prevent SQL Injection & XSS)
- Prevent input-based attacks such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) with strict input validation.

### 5. Secure API Endpoints
- Use API authentication and authorization mechanisms like OAuth 2.0 or API keys.
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse (e.g., brute force attacks, DDoS).
- Validate all incoming requests and avoid exposing unnecessary data.

### 6. Implement Proper Error Handling & Logging
- Do not expose sensitive error messages to users; use generic messages instead.
- Log security-related events but avoid logging sensitive information like passwords.
- Use centralized logging with tools like ELK Stack, Jaeger, etc.

### 7. Keep Software & Dependencies Updated
- Regularly update CMS, frameworks, libraries, and plugins to patch security vulnerabilities.

### 8. Regular Security Audits & Penetration Testing
- Conduct regular security tests to find and fix potential vulnerabilities before they are attacked.
